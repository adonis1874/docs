## Initial Setup
<Steps>

Upon completion, you will notice that bleed has created two channels, as shown below. The **jail-log** channel is where all the logs for moderation actions goes, and the **jail** channel is where jailed users are restricted to.

Additionally, Bleed will have created 3 roles for muting of members, as seen below.

### What do these roles do?
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Jail">
    Restricts a member to only being able to see your jail channel. Make sure to run `settings jailroles true` in order to remove a user's roles upon jailing them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Muted">
  Removes a member's permission to talk in channels. This is made possible with the addition of the mute role with the permission denied.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Image Muted">
    Removes a member's permission to attach files and embed links in channels. This is made possble with the addition of the imute role with that permission denied.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reaction Muted">
    Removes a member's permission to add reactions and send external emoji and stickers in channels. This is made possible with the addition of the rmute role with that permission denied.
