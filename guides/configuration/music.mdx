## Base Commands

With bleed, you can stream songs from multiple different sources to a voice channel. This can be done through the base `play` command.

<Tip>If bleed doesn't play your desired track, try including the artist. If that still doesn't work, you can use a link!</Tip>

You aren't limited to tracks with this command! You can use Spotify playlists as well.
To queue a playlist, use the `play (playlist link)` command.

To view the current queue, you can use the `queue` command.

        queue remove [position]
        ```

        queue move [position] [new position]
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Shuffle the queue">
        This command is used to shuffle the current queue.

        queue shuffle
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Empty the queue">

    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Setting a DJ role

When a member who didn't start the music tries to control the player, they might get a warning saying only a DJ or an admin can control the player.

Setting a DJ role can be done by using the `settings dj [role]` command.

Any member with this role will be able to bypass this restriction and control the player.

## Autoplay

When your final track finishes, bleed will stop playing music. This can be avoided by turning on **autoplay**!
Autoplay fetches tracks from Spotify that you might like based on your previous tracks.

You can enable this by using the `settings autoplay on` command.

<Frame type="glass" caption="Turning on autoplay">

You can disable autoplay with the `settings autoplay off` command.

## Presets

While listening to music with bleed, you can apply presets, like filters, to the track.
This creates a unique listening experience that can be modified to fit your liking.

<Info>You can view all applied presets with the `preset active` command.</Info>
